## AND BEFORE THAT, 
I worked in five states in several jobs that offered valuable experience: **bar-back, IT helpdesk technician, swim instructor, cashier, lifeguard. I worked on two presidential campaigns and was a professional gerrymanderer.**

In the 1990s, after six months of rigorous on-mountain and classroom training, I **failed** the role-playing part of U.S. National Ski Patrol's Outdoor Emergency Care exam while passing the exam's skills and written sections with flying colors. The examiner portraying a hot-headed race director successfully rattled my nerves, and I endangered my "patient" by acquiescing to the director's emphatic instructions to clear the run rather than carefully completing a medical assessment to ensure the injured skier was safe to move. For a while, I thought the lesson was that I should push back on those who would wield power irresponsibly. But over time I have come to think of it as a parable about risk blindness: *when you encounter risk, you have a responsibility to communicate it up to those who cannot clearly see the potential liability themselves.* A significant part of my career since has been identifying risk and recommending mitigation strategies: very few executives have ever yelled at me for telling them about a serious problem they didn't know they had.
